# ProjektExcelVBA

In this project we compared two popular sorting algorythms,
focusing on their different implementations in VBA, different working times,
and testing them on randomly created arrays and partially sorted arrays.


Sortowanie.pdf - A LaTeX raport containg our results.  
Projekt_VBA.xmls - Excel file containing the test arrays, with time comparison and all of the VBA code in the Developer tag.
